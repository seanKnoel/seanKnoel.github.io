        <h1> Welcome to Sean's Programming Portfolio. </h1>
        
        <h2> <p> My names Sean Noel I am a sophomore and majoring in computer science. I live in Warwick Rhode Island but am originally from Florida.
          I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters for a total of 7 kids including myself. This is my first time actually coding so a lot of my programs will be bare minimum but
          I hopefully see improvement as the semester goes on. </p> </h2>
